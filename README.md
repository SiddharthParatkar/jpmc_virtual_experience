# jpmc_virtual_experience
This contains all the code I wrote and edited for the JPMorgan & Chase Virtual Experience in June 2020. 

Each task corresponds to a different part of the overall task provided by JPMC, which is to help traders at their firm analyze stock trends better. 

The code is written in Python and Typescript and utilized Git. The overall experience focused on data visualization as well as incorporating aspects from JPMC's proprietary software, Perspective.
