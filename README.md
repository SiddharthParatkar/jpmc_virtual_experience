# Overview
The JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) Virtual Experience was completed by me in June 2020. Each folder task corresponds to a separate task given by the team at JPMC with instructions on how to complete it. The code was written with the intention to use it alongside JPMC's proprietary software, Perspective.

# Motivation
The context for the tasks are as follows: JPMC wants to develop a new way for the company to analyze stock prices, trends and historical data, and then alert their traders of a potential buying opportunity. The code to do all of these things will be written by the dashing software engineer tasked with the project *(okay, I added the dashing bit)*, with a basic skeleton provided by JPMC.

# Skills/Languages Used
Throughout this project, I was able to both develop skills of my own and exercise old skills. In the latter category, I used Python to write the data visualization code and use version control to collect the code and push it back to JPMC. As for new skills, this was my first project-based experience with JavaScript and React, which were both useful to display the data and the graphs generated. Finally, I learned a lot about financial data feeds and general data visualization, key themes in this project.

# Errors
Because part of the code I used for the project is not my own, I cannot provide all of the files for the project. 
Each task corresponds to a different part of the overall task provided by JPMC, which is to help traders at their firm analyze stock trends better.
